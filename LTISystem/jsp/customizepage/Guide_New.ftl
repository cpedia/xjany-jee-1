<h2>Missions</h2>

<p>ValidFi's mission is to provide <span style="font:bold" class="orange">holistic, systematic, comprehensive and actionable</span> strategies for financial planning and investment. The holistic approach means ValidFi starts from the overall financial and investment portfolio planning and moves down to individual strategies. The systematic approach means ValidFi's strategies are consistent, precise and step by step. ValidFi collects many financial strategies found in magazines, books, academic papers and those proposed by users. Finally, the strategies provided are actionable and can be readily used in practice. We specialize in <span class="orange"><bl>HOW</bl></span>, not just <span class="orange"><bl>WHAT.</bl><span></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>ValidFi's approach ceters around quantitative strategies. The strategy center collects many strategies ranging from financial planning to asset allocation to asset investment. These strategies form a rich knowledge base for users to study, apply or merely use as references. The portfolio center provides actionable portfolios based on (multiple) strategies. Model portfolios are supplied to showcase how to construct and monitor a portfolio. The tool center provides a quantitative platform for portfolio simulation and analysis, asset allocation and financial planning (forthcoming). The fund center provides real time asset allocation for mutual funds and ETFs. Furthermore, mutual fund trading styles could be analyzed based on the funds' underlying a behavior or strategy employed.</p>

<h2>Strategies</h2>

<p>If you are a first time user, we strongly urge you to read the financial planning and asset allocation sections. These are the most important foundation for your success in financial investment.</p>

<p>Once you identify your overall strategies, you now could proceed to individual asset class investment strategies.</p>

<p>In ValidFi, a strategy is constructed using a time based programming language with Java syntax.  A strategy could be associated with several model portfolios. It could be also used for other portfolios. ValidFi provides rich APIs for manipulating the underlying portfolio and initiate buy/sell trading methods. It provides many technical indicators. Furthermore, linking to third party libraries such as the open source R is provided to access to powerful time series and statistical functions. The classes of ValidFi's strategies are shown in Figure 2. </p>

<p>The following are the classes of strategies. Click on the links to get more information for each class. </p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Financial Planning Strategies</h3>

<p>Many times, novice investors jump right into stock market or other financial instruments without clearly identifying their financial goals and risk tolerance. This is by far the most serious common mistake.</p>

<p>Financial planning has two major components: cash flow strategies and estate planning. Cash flow strategies are for your long term cash flow needs while estate planning is for your long lasting wealth. The outcome of the planning is a workable plan for investment portfolios with clear return and risk factors identified.</p>

<p>ValidFi offers a collection of cash flow investment strategies. The typical examples are the retirement withdrawal rate strategies in good time and bad time. Value averaging and dollar cost average are strategies on how to invest in the risky asset classes such as stock markets with a (planned) stream of cash income.</p>

<p>ValidFi plans to offer advanced cash flow planning and estate planning tools in the future.</p>
 </li>
 <li><h3>Portfolio Level Strategies</h3>
 <p> These strategies are for the overall portfolio asset allocation and management. </p>
 <ul>
   <li><span><a target="_blank" href="../ajax/${HomeURL}StrategyClass3&includeHeader=true">Asset Allocation Strategies</a></span></li>
   <li><span><a target="_blank" href="../ajax/${HomeURL}StrategyClass4&includeHeader=true">Rebalancing Strategies</a><span></li>       
   <li><span><a target="_blank" href="../ajax/${HomeURL}StrategyClass5&includeHeader=true">Cash Flow Strategies</a></span></li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Asset Level Strategies</h3>
<p>For each asset invested, ValidFi collects their corresponding strategies. These include strategies for investing stock markets, real estate investment trusts (REITs), fixed income, commodities, convertibles etc.</p>
   <ul>
   <li><span><a target="_blank" href="../ajax/${HomeURL}StrategyClass9&includeHeader=true">Equity (Stock) Investment Strategies</a></span></li>
   <li><span><a target="_blank" href="../ajax/${HomeURL}StrategyClass10&includeHeader=true">Fixed Income (Bond) Investment Strategies</a></span></li> 
   <li><span><a target="_blank" href="../ajax/${HomeURL}StrategyClass14&includeHeader=true">Commodities Investment Strategie</a></span></li>

   </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>Portfolio Center</h2>

<p>There are two types of portfolios in ValidFi. Strategies could have one or many so called 'model portfolios'. These model portfolios are created to monitor their strategies. Since a strategy could have parameters and various time period, multiple model portfolios could be created for each combination.</p>
<p>The second type of portfolios are for general purpose. Users create these portfolios with multiple strategies or even multiple portfolios. Unlike other stock/commodity trading systems, ValidFi treats portfolio level asset allocation, rebalancing and asset classes (which are commonly used in today's institutional investment practice) as first class citizens. It provides place holders for specifying portfolio level strategies, asset classfications and individual asset class strategies. </p>

<p>As a service to our members, ValidFi also follows a list of <a target="_blank" href="../ajax/${HomeURL}ModelPortfolios&&includeHeader=true">model portfolios.</a></p>

<p>ValidFi also provides <a href="../portfolio/Main.action">a table of all private and public portfolios with search capability.</a> The private portfolios are those created by users and they are for private use. The public portfolios include users created public portfolios and those provided by ValidFi. </p>

<h2>Tool Center</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Platform</h3>
<p>ValidFi offers an institutional quality platform for planning and investment strategies and portfolio management. Its salient features include:</p>
   <ul>
   <li> Structured Portfolio Construction: asset allocation, strategies and portfolios are first class citizens.</li>
   <li> Programmable Strategies.</li>   
   <li> Local execution: simulating a portfolio could be carried out in local machines to allow support of proprietary data and APIs. This reduces the slowdown for our central servers too.</li>
   <li> Historical simulation of portfolios: back testing based on historical data for a portfolio with (multiple) strategies.</li>
   <li>Portfolio statistics: Analytics of portfolios include MPT (Modern Portfolio Theory) statistics: The very basic goal of investment is to achieve good returns with reasonable risk. Popular statistics such as annualized returns, IRR (Internal Rate of Return), alpha, beta, standard deviation, Sharpe and maximum drawdown for various periods are computed.</li>
   <li>Powerful charting: The portfolio transaction log, other messages and the statistics are viewed through annotated charts.</li>
   <li>Live monitoring of portfolios including trading signals: Portfolios could be setup as 'LIVE' and ValidFi will automatically update the portfolios based on the current markets.</li>
   <li>Hierarchical Portfolio Construction: ValidFi offers a powerful and natural way to allow a portfolio to be hierarchically constructed. An example is the Simple Core Satellite Portfolio strategy. This portfolio consists of two other portfolios and they in term are made of other portfolios. Multiple strategies could be developed and evaluated using this feature. Diversification not only comes as multiple asset class investment, but also as multiple strategies on those asset classes or even in the overall portfolio asset/strategy allocation.</li>
   <li>Statistical significance testing for investment strategies: confidence level testing is provided for rigorous study of the effectiveness of strategies.</li>
   <li>Up to date latest news and discussion feeds: ValidFi will automatically search well qualified web sources on any update, newly published books and papers on individual strategies.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Asset Allocation Tools</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="../MVO/main.jsp" target="_blank">Mean Variance Optimization:</a>Markowwitz's mean variance (or so called efficient frontier) method could be used to do conventional asset allocation or even to determine the weights of multiple strategies in a portfolio. </li>
 <li><a href="../blapp/BasicSetup.action?action=create" target="_blank">Black-Litterman's Asset Allocation Method:</a> unlike a normal Markowitz's mean variance optimization method, this tool takes users' outlook for the various asset classes expected returns and their confidence and perform the asset allocation optimization. Its output is much more stable and intuitive than the mean variance method. </li>
</ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="../security/ScreeningMain.action">Screening tool:</a> provides searching, screening capabilities for funds, portfolios and closed end funds or other securities. </li>
</ul>
<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>Fund Center</h2>

<p>ValidFi provides several analytical tools for financial products including mutual funds.</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="../mutualfund/calculate.jsp">RAA: Realtime Asset Allocation analyzer for mutual funds and ETFs.</a></span>This allows users to track down the asset exposure in a mutual fund (usually a flexible allocation fund, a balance or conservative fund). For example, GMO Alpha Only III (GGHEX) is an institutional fund which requires minimum 10 million US dollars to invest. However, using this tool, one could monitor and mimic its allocation in real time.</li>
<li>Carhart's four factors model analysis for a fund.</li>
<li>Closed end fund discount rate screening using the <a target="_blank" href="../security/ScreeningMain.action">screening tool.</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div> 
<h2>User Communities and Forums</h2>

<p>ValidFi provides organized discussion forums to support user activities and exchange of ideas. Specifically, forum topics will be automatically fed to relevant strategies or portfolios created by users or ValidFi.</p>
