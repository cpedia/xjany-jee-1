<h1>Overview</h1>
<hr>
<p>Cash flow strategies are about how a portfolio is constructed to handle cash inflow (income stream) and cash outflow (spending or withdrawing). When cash is deposited into a portfolio, when and how much is allocated to an asset class could have material impact on the portfolio's return. Similarly, when and how much an asset is sold to accommodate cash withdrawal not only could have impact on the portfolio return but also on the life of the portfolio value.</p>

<p>ValidFi collects two cash investment strategies: Value Averaging and Dollar Cost Average (DCA). These strategies are closely related to other strategies such as portfolio rebalancing strategies.</p>

<p>For a retirement account, there have been numerous studies on withdrawal rate. ValidFi collects some of the strategies and plans to offer many more as time goes.</p>

<p>Other strategies include target date funds or life cycle funds.</p>

<p>Typical measures for cash flow strategies are the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and residual portfolio values after a period of time. </p>

<hr>
<p>For a portfolio which has cash inflow and cash outflow, ValidFi utilizes a common return metric called IRR (Internal Rate of Return) to measure the investment return. The IRR takes the timing of cash inflow and cash outflow into account while calculating the actual investment return.</p>

<p>In addition to the cash inflow and cash outflow, the portfolio construction is the major determining factor to achieve a better cash flow in a lifetime or perpetual portfolio. In our studies, strategies are usually coupled with some of well known static (lazy) portfolios but users might want to use our portfolio tools to combine these strategies with other portfolios such as those dynamic asset allocation strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash inflow investment strategies:

<p>When investors have income stream or a lump sum of cash to invest, it is prudent to have a systematic strategy instead of simply taking a one time lump sum purchase (although this might be a valid strategy at times when it seems plausible such as when stock market is at extreme low valuation situation). ValidFi collects two such strategies: Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) and Value Averaging (VA). DCA has been widely recommended by experts and brokerages alike due to its simplicity and regularity. However, VA has been shown to achieve better risk adjusted return.</p> 

<p>There are variations of these strategies and some of them are related to portfolio rebalancing or asset allocation.</p>
</li>

<li>Retirement spending strategies:

<p>For a retirement account, numerous strategies have been proposed on how to manage the spending (withdrawal) so that the portfolio could satisfy the lifetime spending and/or could leave out the estate. This is not only important for retirees, but also very useful for university endowment spending.</p>

<p>ValidFi collects strategies ranging from fixed rule of thumb (usually 4%) to dynamic withdrawal rate strategies. </p>
