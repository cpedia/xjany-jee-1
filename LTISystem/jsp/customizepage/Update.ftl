            <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2009/02/26/bill-gross-the-747-billion-bond-man-declares-the-death-of-equ/">Bill Gross, the $747 billion bond man, declares the death of equities</a>. In this Feb. 26, 2009's blog, Bill Gross was quoted that "the current economic contraction is killing the animal spirits that drive risk taking and that's contributing to the death of equity capitalism as we've come to know it". Human innovation and capitalism all have something to do with human's animal spirits. If in fact, this downturn does kill the spirit, it will take a long time for the society to swing back to what we have seen in the last twenty or so years. Such scenarios would entail us not to just rely too much on what our current generations have been used to make financial and investment judgments in the near term.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gmo.com/websitecontent/JGLetter_ALL_4Q08.pdf">Latest GMO's quarterly report</a> by Jeremy Grantham. Two key points here: 1). there are no sure bets in almost all of the asset classes right now: Equity is attractive but near term may go lower; emerging markets are slowing; currencies have had big runs; long term inflation is mild but no near sight visibility. 2). asset allocation achieves much better risk adjusted return than individual stock pick alpha as major asset class shifting is associated with career risk for institutional managers. The second point is very much illustrated by ValidFi's asset class rotation strategies including those <a target="_top" href="../strategy/View.action?ID=445&action=view">Goldman Sachs' global tactical asset allocation strategy</a> and <a target="_top" href="../strategy/View.action?ID=4525&action=view">Global tactical asset allocation (momentum)</a>. </li>
            <li><a target="_top" href="http://online.barrons.com/article/SB123396545910358867.html">Recession? No, It's a D-process, and It Will Be Long</a>: Bridgewater's Ray Dalio's interview by Barrons on Feb. 9, 2009. In this excellent interview, Ray Dalio stated that the deleveraging process across the globe will be long and painful. This is not a normal recession. In his opinion, the equity market will only bottom at the year end. </li>
