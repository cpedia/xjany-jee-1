           <h1>US Equity Exposure</h1>
           <p>Hussman Strategic Growth Fund (HSGFX) and James Balance Golden Rainbow (GLRBX) are mainly US equity hedging and balance funds. They had exceptional performance during the 2008 turmoil. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>HSGFX has been fully hedged recently. <a target="_blank" href="${HSGFXRAAanalysis}">See the latest RAA analysis here</a>.</li>
                <li>GLRBX increased its equity exposure in December 2008 and since then, it has been steady. <a target="_blank" href="${GLRBXRAAanalysis}">See the latest RAA analysis here</a>. </li>
              </ul>
           <h1>US Equity Sector Exposure</h1>
           <p>Several stock fund managers exhibit great sector call. Ken Heebner's CGM Focus (CGMFX) is one of them. CGMFX, however, did pay dear during the 2008 financial crash because Heebner made a much early investment into the financial sector. Unfortunately, it has under performed up till now. It has increased its exposure in material sectors dramatically since the end of the June of 2009.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Here is the <a target="_blank" href="${CGMFXRAAanalysis}">CGMFX&rsquo;s latest sector exposure</a>.</li>

            <h1>Diversified Asset Classes Exposure</h1>
            <p>Jeremy Grantham's GMO Alpha Only III (GGHEX), Steven Leuthold's Core Fund (LCORX), Ivy Asset Management's Asset Strategy (WASAX) and PIMCO All Asset (PASDX) managed by Rob Arnott in Research Affiliated are all excellent funds which have flexible exposures over diversified asset classes including US Equity, Foreign Equity, Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), Commodities, US bonds and Foreign bonds.</p>
             <ul>
              <li>GMO Alpha Only (GGHEX) has very little or negative exposure to US equity at this moment. <a target="_blank" href="${GGHEXRAAanalysis}">See the latest RAA analysis here</a>.</li>
              <li>Steve Leuthold's LCORX has steadily raised its exposure in equity since the start of 2009. <a target="_blank" href="${LCORXRAAanalysis}">See the latest RAA analysis here</a>.</li>
              <li>Ivy Asset Strategy (WASAX) has been positive on equity since 2009. <a target="_blank" href="${WASAXRAAanalysis}">See the latest RAA analysis here</a>.</li>
