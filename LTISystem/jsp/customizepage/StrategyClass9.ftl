<h1>Overview</h1>
<hr>
<p>Equity (i.e. stock market) investment is perhaps the most popular and (many times) chaotic and confusing. Investment strategies range from no strategy (i.e. impulsive or emotional, which believe or not, might be the most popular and most dangerous) to buy and hold to trading as frequently as in day trading.</p>

<p>ValidFi provides strategies based on valuation (such as S&P price earning ratio), technical/timing (especially momentum) and various others utilizing mutual funds and closed end funds.</p>

<p>At this moment, ValidFi only provides those based on mutual funds, ETFs and closed end funds. We are planning on offering individual stock investment strategies in the future. </p>

<h1>Tutorials</h1>
<hr>
<p>There are numerous materials on stock market investment. It is well recognized that the market itself (representing general economic conditions), size (large capitalization or small capitalization), value (book to market) and the momentum factor (price momentum) are the major 4 factors influencing the stock investment outcome. Fundamental (valuation) and technical (price movement) are the two most popular techniques.
