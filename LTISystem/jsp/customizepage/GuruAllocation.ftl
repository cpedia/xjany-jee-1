<p><sup style="color:red">New!</sup> The recently introduced <a target="_top" href="../strategy/View.action?ID=544&action=view">Guru Asset Allocation Clone</a> strategy has an impressive risk/return profile: from 7/30/2001 to 7/15/2009, its model portfolio <a target="_top" href="../portfolio/Edit.action?ID=4406">P Guru Asset Allocation Clone with Diversified Bonds</a> has achieved <strong>10% annualized return, 21% maximum drawdown, 8.9% annualized standard deviation and, 0.95 Sharpe ratio.</strong> Every month, the strategy selects the top 2 asset allocation funds (among a few selective mutual funds managed by famed asset allocation gurus) and applies ValidFi's RAA (Realtime Asset Allocation) analysis to derive the asset exposures of these two funds and adjusts its asset exposures accordingly. </p>

           <h1>US Equity Exposure</h1>
           <p>Hussman Strategic Growth Fund (HSGFX) and James Balance Golden Rainbow (GLRBX) are mainly US equity hedging and balance funds. They had exceptional performance during the 2008 turmoil. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>HSGFX has been fully hedged recently. <a target="_blank" href="${HSGFXRAAanalysis}">See the latest RAA analysis here</a>.</li>
                <li>GLRBX started to decrease its equity exposure since mid of June this year. This is significant as the stock market rose during this period of time. <a target="_blank" href="${GLRBXRAAanalysis}">See the latest RAA analysis here</a>. </li>
              </ul>
           <h1>US Equity Sector Exposure</h1>
           <p>Several stock fund managers exhibit great sector call. Ken Heebner's CGM Focus (CGMFX) is one of them. CGMFX, however, did pay dear during the 2008 financial crash because Heebner made a much early investment into the financial sector. Unfortunately, it has under performed up till now. It has increased its exposure in material sectors dramatically since the end of the June of 2009.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Here is the <a target="_blank" href="${CGMFXRAAanalysis}">CGMFX&rsquo;s latest sector exposure</a>.</li>

            <h1>Diversified Asset Classes Exposure</h1>
            <p>Jeremy Grantham's GMO Benchmark-Free Allocation III (GBMFX), Steven Leuthold's Core Fund (LCORX), Ivy Asset Management's Asset Strategy (WASAX) and PIMCO All Asset (PASDX) managed by Rob Arnott in Research Affiliated are all excellent funds which have flexible exposures over diversified asset classes including US Equity, Foreign Equity, Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), Commodities, US bonds and Foreign bonds.</p>
             <ul>
              <li>GMO Benchmark-Free Allocation (GBMFX) increased its equity exposure before mid of June this year and has maintained about 60% fixed income and 40% equity allocation since then. <a target="_blank" href="${GBMFXRAAanalysis}">See the latest RAA analysis here</a>.</li>

              <li>Steve Leuthold's LCORX has steadily raised its exposure in equity since the start of 2009. <a target="_blank" href="${LCORXRAAanalysis}">See the latest RAA analysis here</a>.</li>
              <li>Ivy Asset Strategy (WASAX) has been positive on equity since 2009. <a target="_blank" href="${WASAXRAAanalysis}">See the latest RAA analysis here</a>.</li>
              <li>Rob Arnott's PASDX has been steadfast on minor equity exposure while having heavy exposure to US bonds. <a target="_blank" href="${PASDXRAAanalysis}">See the latest RAA analysis here</a>.</li>
