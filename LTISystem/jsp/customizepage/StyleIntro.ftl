<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the previous article, we introduced the concept of diversifying along investment strategy styles. In this article, we will discuss several strategy styles in some detail.</span></span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Value investment: this has been one of the major styles employed by many famed investors including Warren Buffett in stock and bond investment (Buffett value investment in bonds, though less well known, is as impressive as his stock investment).     </span></span>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><b>Relative value investment in Asset Allocation: </b>among major assets, their relative values are computed and then are ranked across those assets. The cheapest assets are invested and the most expensive assets are sold. The hardest issue here is how to come up with comparable values across disparate asset classes. In strategy </span></span><a href="http://www.validfi.com/LTISystem/jsp/strategy/View.action?ID=460&amp;action=view"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Global Tactical Asset Allocation Value Based</span></span></a><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> maintained by validfi.com, earning yields (i.e. Earning/Price) are used for equities while yields to maturity are used for the bonds. These yields are then adjusted with a constant assigned to each asset class. More detailed information could be found in </span></span><a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1079975"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Global Tactical Cross-Asset Allocation: Applying Value and Momentum Across Asset Classes</span></span></a><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> which the strategy is based. In another paper titled </span></span><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1363476"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Value and Momentum Everywhere</span></span></a><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> by Clifford Asness et. al from AQR Capital, a 5-year negative return (price five years ago divided by current price) is used as &quot;values&quot; for commodities as well as currencies.         </span></span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><b>Equities (stocks) value investing:</b> there are many well known techniques here. Price Earning ratio (P/E),&nbsp; Price Book ratio (P/B), Price (Free) Cash Flow ratio etc. have been used as value measures. Many books and articles have been written.

        <li><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><b>Bonds</b>: the most obvious area is in credit market, especially in high yield (junk) bonds and distressed debt markets.         </span></span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs):          </span></span></li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Momentum investment: as one of the most popular investment styles, this has been often scolded as &quot;herd&quot; or &quot;price chaser&quot;.     </span></span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Contrarians or mean reversion:     </span></span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hedging:     </span></span></li>
